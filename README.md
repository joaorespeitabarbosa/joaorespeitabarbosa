## About Me
Hi! I'm João Respeita Barbosa, an MSc in Computer Science & Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico.

My thesis, **“Personality-Based Dialogues for Bystander Non-Playable Characters,”** gave me hands-on experience integrating Large Language Models into a game editor to generate dynamic NPC dialogues based on personality traits. During my Erasmus at **Politecnico di Torino**, I explored parametric and algorithmic modeling, creating sustainable design solutions for real-world building projects.

I’m open to roles where I can apply **AI, Game Development, or Interactive Systems** to create engaging, innovative software experiences.
